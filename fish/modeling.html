                <h1>Modeling stuff</h1>
                <p>I've done a bit of 3D modeling over the past ~2 years <s>and I've barely improved</s>. I use Blender for the modeling process and Photopea for the texturing process. If you're interested, heres some of the stuff I've made:</p>

                <p>If you want to commission me, I uhh wouldn't recomend it. I don't really take my modeling seriously and doze off 80% of the time. <i>Finding another person is probably best lol</i></p>

                <h2>Why I even set myself up for this?</h2>
                <p>I started modeling around December 2023, it was only supposed to be a one-time fun thing I did until one of my fan-creations for someone got noticed and wanted to commission me for my <s>horrible</s> model.</p>
                <p>After making a few models for them, people started to discover me more frequently somehow, even though I had no other means of contact other than Discord.</p>
                <p>This was during a time where in the platform Roblox, making/uploading stuff and giving them out for free or for profit was a popular decision, so modelers were in a sorta highish demand. Throughout 2023 until the first half of 2024, I was getting handfuls of model requests
                    even though I knew that my modeling skill were still kinda at a beginner level.</p>
                <p>"OGHHHGHHHHHHHHH" - 2024 me</p>
                <p>Although now, I barely get any model requests now, which I'm fine with. I'm still not fully advanced into Blender yet though lol.</p>
