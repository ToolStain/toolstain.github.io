                <h1>Touhou Project!!!</h1>
                <p><b>1/1/26:</b> WOW, managed to complete all N1CCs for my Touhou chart before 2026. SA was by far the most hardest N1CC out of the bunch. Took around 6+ hours just to beat it on normal.
                On the other hand, for UFO, which I thought would be more harder, I somehow managed to just sickgrab with a single credit with SanaeB...</p>

                <h2>Other Touhou Stuff</h2>

                <p>I got into Touhou's community in around 2020 because of its music and amount of fan-content (Bad Apple).</p>
                <p>I never played the real Touhou games until 4 years later, June 6th, 2024. It was a really rough start, on my first playthrough in Touhou 7 - Perfect Cherry Blossom, one of the "easiest" games, on easy mode with an extra 2 lives, I only made it to stage 4 out of 6.</p>
