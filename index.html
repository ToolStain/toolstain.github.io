                <p>I do various stuff, but I'm not particularly good at any one thing.
                    <br>Althought, if you still want to know, I'm decent at these things:
                </p>
                <li>Coding in the languages Python and <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/">AutoHotKey v1.1</a> — I am also trying to learn HTML</li>
                <li>2D and 3D modeling and animating</li>

                <h1>Blender</h1>
                <p>I started modeling around December 2023, it was only supposed to be a one-time fun thing I did until one of my fan-creations for someone got noticed and wanted to commission me for my <s>horrible</s> model.</p>
                <p>After making a few models for them, people started to discover me more frequently somehow, even though I had no other means of contact other than Discord.</p>
                <p>This was during a time where in the platform Roblox, making/uploading stuff and giving them out for free or for profit was a popular decision, so modelers were in a sorta highish demand. Throughout 2023 until the first half of 2024, I was getting handfuls model requests
                    even though I knew that my modeling skill were still kinda at a beginner level.</p>
                <p>As a result, I kinda got burned out lol</p>
                <p>Although now, as of 2025, I barely get any model requests now, which I'm fine with. I'm still not fully advanced into Blender yet though.</p>

                <h1>Game Impacts</h1>
                <p>I've only played in a relatively small circle of games, maybe I would make a stronger bond with more games and game genres if I actually played more games outside my circle?
                    Regardless, the games I've played in my circle has left a big impact on me.
                </p>

                <h2>Touhou Project</h2>
                <p>Touhou Project has probably made some of the biggest impacts on me. I think I first heard of Touhou in 2020 from either Bad Apple or Ronald McDonald insanity. Around 2021, I really got into Touhou from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTKCtyD8kBY">JZBoy's Frisk/Chara vs. Sakuya Fight Animation<a>
                    back when I used to watch Undertale Content. After making a few searches about Touhou, I discovered Touhou's music, fan-remixes and fan-content, which caused my everlasting love for Touhou.</p>
                <p>I never played the real game until June 6th, 2024. It was a really rough start, on my first playthrough in PCB on easy mode with an extra 2 lives, I only made it to stage 4.</p>
                <p>However, it was a really fun experience getting blasted with unfamiliar danmaku and new music I've never heard before, which pushed me to try all of the other games throughout Touhou Project.</p>
                <p>So far, this is my current completion chart: </p>

                <h2>Undertale</h2>
                <p>Undertale is a game that will also be with me with the rest of time. I honestly forgot how I discovered Undertale in the first place, I assume it was from its music and the flood of fan-content?</p>
                <p>When I was younger, I used to explore alot of fanworks based off Undertale for a long while, which showed me many different fan-projects and introduced me to many new games, such as Touhou Project and OneShot.</p>
                <p>I probably stayed in that community for too long, I've been beyond brainrotted with the amount fan-content people made... I still love the game though.</p>

                <h3>and various other games...</h3>
